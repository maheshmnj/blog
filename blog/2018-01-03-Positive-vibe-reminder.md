#### It is lack of motivation!

I believe you need motivation even to walk couple of steps, you need enough motivation to do every single thing and to accomplish it, Motivation in the sense implies confidence when you are confident to do a certain job, the level of confidence defines your swiftness and quality of work being done. these words may sound a little mumbo Jumbo but once you realize it the results will be life changing.
We live in the world where people will push you down every time you try to rise up its not physically but mentally of course, because theres a race with the world may it be in terms of humans or rest of the species on the planet everyone wants a control over the other, but if you want change you need to ignore and do what is right and work with 0% expectation and ultimately what matters is How you react to it.

> “When experts declare a certain thing as Impossible a boy goes straight and makes it possible. do you know How????” Because, the boy did not knew it was Impossible."

To stay confident and motivated you need to spend time for yourself, Make sure you follow your passion which will in return make sure you are Happy, Because Happiness is the thing that will make your every work productive and effective, What’s your passion are you really doing what you are best at?? speak to yourself what’s going on in your mind? and most importantly you must be able to see the big Picture about what you are going to do about it and How are you going to do it . We are often stuck thinking about the future and the past and we hardly focus on the present….

### How are you feeling right now??

If Happy then let it continue and if not then change your mood that’s so simple as switching a TV channel, think of your happy moments from the past, think of a child you love, your favorite food you would love to have, the person who had a great influence on you or the person who you admire the most, or think of your life where you will be after 5 years 10 years and 20 years (be positive of course).

No matter what has happened with you or How bad state or situation you are going through, there are people in the world in the worst state you can hardly imagine and theres always a way to make things better.

> With the begin of this new Year, I want you to be a completely revived today and totally changed and Optimistic and always remember if you expect the best results be prepared to give your best and be the hardest working guy in the room because Big solid things aren’t achieved easily..

I wish you will go to your next heights this year and see your potential and possibilities and lets Rock this time and lets put our efforts on fire and Make things Happen.
